# Unity MCP Project

This project implements a Model Context Protocol (MCP) system in Unity, designed to manage and coordinate model-context relationships and data flow between different components.

## Overview

The MCP (Model Context Protocol) serves as a protocol system for managing model-context relationships, data states, and communication patterns within the Unity environment. It provides a structured approach for handling data flow and context-based interactions between models and components.

## Key Features

- Centralized game state management
- Event-driven communication system
- Component coordination and lifecycle management
- Modular system architecture
- Easy integration with existing Unity components
